Python codes for paper (in submission): Systematic pan-cancer analysis of mutation-treatment interactions using large real-world clinico-genomics data.

The findings from our study are visualized in www.precision-cancer.org.


# Quick Guidance


### Main codes

In [main.ipynb](https://github.com/RuishanLiu/precision-cancer/tree/master/main.ipynb), we present our codes to analyze
- Association between mutations and patient survival.
- Gene-treatment interactions.
- Mutation-mutation interactions.


### Synthetic Data

The synthetic data used as an illustration are provided in [synthetic_data.csv](https://github.com/RuishanLiu/precision-cancer/tree/master/synthetic_data.csv). The detailed descriptions are included in the notebook [main.ipynb](https://github.com/RuishanLiu/precision-cancer/tree/master/main.ipynb).
